# WeSee

Dynamic visualization of Web Service (WS) use

An App is not an “island”.
It connects to  REST/SOAP Web Services, APIs, etc.
Many times, the App programmers are not even aware of it because they use libraries that do the calls.

WeSee is a tool that:
- Intercepts outgoing communications
- Displays connections as they happen in a graphical display
- Raises awareness of coders and end-users of the network use of Apps

WeSee will be published with an open-source license (tentatively, the MIT license).

WeSee will have a companion short paper (4 pages) that details the architecture and technical options.

This is a Java library with several JAX-WS SOAP handlers.
More handlers can be added.


Instructions using Maven:
------------------------

To compile package:
  mvn package
  (a JAR file is created containing the compiled classes and a generated manifest)

To install package:
  mvn install
  (the JAR is made available in the local maven repository ~/.m2/repository)
  (other projects can now refer to the library as a dependency)


To configure the Maven project in Eclipse:
-----------------------------------------

'File', 'Import...', 'Maven'-'Existing Maven Projects'
'Select root directory' and 'Browse' to the project base folder.
Check that the desired POM is selected and 'Finish'.
